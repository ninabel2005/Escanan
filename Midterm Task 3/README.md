## Midterm Lab Task 3: Creating Pivot Tables and Dashboard

In this task, we focused on building a dynamic and interactive dashboard using **Pivot Tables**, **charts**, and **slicers** to visualize insights from the transformed dataset.

## Step 1: Data Preparation

- **Load the Dataset**:  
  Open the worksheet containing the cleaned and transformed data from the *Uncleaned DS Jobs* file.

---

## Step 2: Creating Pivot Tables

We created several Pivot Tables to analyze salary data based on different dimensions:

- **Salary by Role**

- **Salary by State**  
  <img src="" align="center" height="350" width="600"/>

- **Salary by Company Size**  
  <img src="" align="center" height="350" width="600"/>

## Step 3: Designing the Dashboard

- **Insert Charts**:  
  Convert Pivot Tables into visual charts:
  
  - **Salary by Role**: Use a **Bar Chart** or **Column Chart**  
  - **Salary by State**: Use a **Bar Chart** or **Column Chart**  
  - **Salary by Size**: Use a **Pie Chart** or **Bar Chart**

## Step 4: Adding Interactivity with Slicers

- **Insert Slicers**:
  - Select a Pivot Table (e.g., Salary by Role)  
  - Go to **Insert > Slicer**  
  - Choose filter fields such as *State*, *Size*, or *Role*  
  - Repeat for other Pivot Tables as needed to maintain synchronization

## Step 5: Customizing Dashboard Design

- **Apply Design and Colors**:
  - Use **Home > Cell Styles** or manually format chart elements  
  - Enhance visual appeal using **Chart Tools > Design**

---

## Step 6: Making the Dashboard Interactive

- Ensure slicers are connected to relevant Pivot Tables  
- Maintain a consistent color scheme and layout for a user-friendly experience

## Step 7: Final Dashboard

Here is the completed interactive dashboard showcasing salary data across various dimensions:
